# open-doors-sanctuary
The idea is to create a web app (desktop and mobile) that will allow fleeing Ukrainians to find a safe haven. It will be similar to Airbnb but instead of charging Ukrainians, it helps to link them to housing from a volunteer family who is willing to take them in. This could be from nato countries or far away from where the fighting is actually happening. The volunteer family would create an account and list the amenities that the fleeing Ukrainians will have access to. The Ukrainians will then be able to create an account and view all the possible safe havens that are available and they sign up for how many days that is needed.
